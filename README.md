# python-tdd-exercises

## Get started

To get started with this project you need to have a working python 3 environment

Then we need pipenv, to get pipenv working run the following

```sh
pip install --user pipenv
# or this if your python 2 has pip available
pip3 install --user pipenv
```

Make sure pipenv is available on your PATH otherwise we need to add it

To get our dependencies run:

```sh
pipenv install
```

Finally to run the test suite run:

```sh
pipenv run test
```
